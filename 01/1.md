# Introduction

## Objectives

The objectives of this chapter are to introduces software engineering and to provide a framework for understanding the rest of the book. When you have read this chapter you will:

- understand what software engineering is and why it is important;
- understand that the development of different types of software systems may require different software engineering techniques;
- understand some ethical and professional issues that are important for software engineers;
- have been introduced to three systems, of different types, that will be used as examples throughout the book.

## KEY POINTS

- Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.
- Software is not just a program or programs but also includes documentation. Essential software product attributes are maintainability, dependability, security, efficiency, and acceptability.
- The software process includes all of the activities involved in software development. The high-level activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution are part of all software processes.
- The fundamental notions of software engineering are universally applicable to all types of system development. These fundamentals include software processes, dependability, security, requirements, and reuse.
- There are many different types of systems and each requires appropriate software engineering tools and techniques for their development. There are few, if any, specific design and implementation techniques that are applicable to all kinds of systems.
- The fundamentals ideas of software engineering are applicable to all types of software systems. These fundamentals include managed software processes, software dependability and security, requirements engineering, and software reuse.
- Software engineers have responsibilities to the engineering profession and society. They should not simply be concerned with technical issues.
- Professional societies publish codes of conduct that set out the standards of behavior expected of their members.

## EXERCISES

1.1 Explain why professional software is not just programs that are developed for a customer.

- Professional software could be also for developers who will maintain and improve the software.
