# Introduction

## Objectives

The objectives of this chapter are to introduces software engineering and to provide a framework for understanding the rest of the book. When you have read this chapter you will:

- understand what software engineering is and why it is important;
- understand that the development of different types of software systems may require different software engineering techniques;
- understand some ethical and professional issues that are important for software engineers;
- have been introduced to three systems, of different types, that will be used as examples throughout the book.

## KEY POINTS

- Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.
- Software is not just a program or programs but also includes documentation. Essential software product attributes are maintainability, dependability, security, efficiency, and acceptability.
- The software process includes all of the activities involved in software development. The high-level activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution are part of all software processes.
- The fundamental notions of software engineering are universally applicable to all types of system development. These fundamentals include software processes, dependability, security, requirements, and reuse.
- There are many different types of systems and each requires appropriate software engineering tools and techniques for their development. There are few, if any, specific design and implementation techniques that are applicable to all kinds of systems.
- The fundamentals ideas of software engineering are applicable to all types of software systems. These fundamentals include managed software processes, software dependability and security, requirements engineering, and software reuse.
- Software engineers have responsibilities to the engineering profession and society. They should not simply be concerned with technical issues.
- Professional societies publish codes of conduct that set out the standards of behavior expected of their members.

## Software engineering

- The economies of ALL developed nations are dependent on software.
- More and more systems are software controlled
- Software engineering is concerned with theories, methods and tools for professional software development.
- Expenditure on software represents a significant fraction of GNP in all developed countries.

## Software costs

- Software costs often dominate computer system costs. The costs of software on a PC are often greater than the hardware cost.
- Software costs more to maintain than it does to develop. For system with a long life, maintenance costs may be several times development costs.
- Software engineering is concerned with cost-effective software development.

## Software project failure

- Increasing system complexity
    - As new software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more complex systems, the demands change. Systems have to be build and delivered more quickly; larger, even more complex systems are required; systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be impossible.
- Failure to use software engineering methods
    - It is easily to write computer programs without using software  engineering methods and techniques. Many companies have drifted into software development asa their products and services have evolved. They do not use software engineering methods in their everyday work. Consequently, their software is often more expensive and less reliable than it should be.

## Frequently asked questions about software engineering

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What is software? | Computer programs and associated documentation. Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market. |
| What are the attributes of good software? | Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable. |
| What is software engineering? | Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production. |
| What are the fundamental software engineering activities? | Software specification, software development, software validation and software evolution. |
| What is the difference between software engineering and computer science? | Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals; software engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing and delivering useful software. |
| What is the difference between software engineering and system engineering? | System engineering is concerned with all aspects of computer-based systems development including hardware, software and process engineering. Software engineering is part of this more general process. |
| What are the key challenges facing software engineering? | Coping with increasing diversity, demands for reduced delivery times and developing trustworthy software. |
| What are the costs of software engineering? | Roughly 60% of software costs are development costs, 40% are testing costs. For custom software, evolution costs often exceed development costs. |
| What are the best software engineering techniques and methods? | While all software projects have to be professionally managed and developed, different techniques are appropriate for different types of system. For example, games should always be developed using a series of prototypes whereas safety critical control systems require a complete and analyzable specification to be developed. You can't, therefore, say that one method is better than another. |
| What differences has the web made to software engineering? | The web has led to the availability of software services and the possibility of developing highly distributed service-based systems. Web-based systems development had led to important advances in programming languages and software reuse. |

## Software products

- Generic products
    - Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them.
    - Examples - PC software such as graphics programs, project management tools; CAD software; software for specific markets such as appointments systems for dentists.
- Customized products
    - Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs.
    - Examples - embedded control systems, air traffic control software, traffic monitoring systems.
    
## Product specification

- Generic products
    - The specification of what software should do is owned by the software developer and decisions on software change are made by the developer.
- Customized products
    -  The specification of what the software should do is owned by the customer for the software and they make decisions on software changes that are required.

## Essential attributes of good software

| Product characteristic | Description |
|---|---|
| Maintainability | Software should be written in such a way so that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers. This is critical attribute because software change is inevitable requirement of a changing business environment. |
| Dependability and security | Software dependability includes a range of characteristics including reliability, security and safety. Dependable software should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of system failure. Malicious users should not be able to  access or damage the system. |
| Efficiency| Software should not make wasteful use of system resources such as memory and processor cycles. Efficiency therefore includes responsiveness, processing time, memory utilization, etc. |
| Acceptability | Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is designed. This means that it must be understandable, usable and compatible with other systems that they use. |

## Software engineering

- Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use.
- Engineering  discipline
    - Using appropriate theories and methods to solve problems bearing in mind organizational and financial constraints.
- All aspects of software production
    - Not just technical process of development. Also project management and the development of tools, methods etc. to support software  production.

## Importance of software engineering

- More and more, individuals and society rely on advanced software systems. We need to be able to  produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly.
- It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering methods and techniques for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a personal programming project. For most types of system, the majority of costs are the costs of changing the software after it has gone into use.

## Software process activities

- Software specification, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.
- Software development, where the software is designed and programmed.
- Software validation, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.
- Software evolution, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.

## General issues that affect software

- Heterogeneity
    - Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed systems across networks that include different types of computer and mobile devices.
- Business and social change
    - Business and society are changing incredibly quickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available. They need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new software.
- Security and trust
    - As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is essential that we can trust that software.
- Scale
    - Software has to be developed across a very wide range of scales, from very small embedded systems in portable or wearable devices through to Internet-scale, cloud-based systems that serve a global community.

## Software engineering diversity

- There are many different types of software system and there is no universal set of software techniques that is applicable to all of these.
- The software engineering methods and tools used depend on the type of application being developed, the requirements of the customer and the background of the development team.

## Application types

- Stand-alone applications
    - These are application systems that run on a local computer, such as a PC. They  include all necessary  functionality and do not need to be connected to a network.
- Interactive transaction-based applications
    - Applications that execute on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own PCs or terminals. These include web applications such as e-commerce applications.
- Embedded control systems
    - These are software control systems that control and manage hardware devices. Numerically, there are probably more embedded systems than any other type of system.
- Batch processing systems
    - These are business systems that are designed to process data in large batches. They process large numbers of individual inputs to create corresponding outputs.
- Entertainment systems
    - These are systems that are primarily for personal use and which are intended to entertain the user.
- Systems for modeling and simulation
    - These are systems that are developed by scientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations, which include many, separate, interacting objects.
- Data collection systems
    - These are systems that collect data from their environment using a set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing.
- Systems of systems
    - These are systems that are composed of a number of other software systems.
